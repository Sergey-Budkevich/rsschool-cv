## About myself:
I chose this direction because I like to create and see the result of my work. I started my learning with John Ducket's book "HTML and CSS". Convinced that I really like this direction, I took courses and continue to expand my knowledge through articles and YouTube. I enjoy writing code and dealing with bugs. I am purposeful, responsible, friendly and calm in relation to routine work. I consider the strong side of my character to be the constant desire to learn new things, improve the knowledge already gained and be the best in my field.
